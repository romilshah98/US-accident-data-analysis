# US accident data analysis
 
This project is all about analysing the US accident dataset, which contains the data from 2016 to 2019.

We analysed different trends of accidents, the factors affecting the accidents and the severity of accidents.

We have also compared the perfomance of 3 tools Spark, VAEX and Pandas.
